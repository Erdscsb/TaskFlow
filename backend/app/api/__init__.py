This file initializes the API Blueprint and the Flask-RESTful Api object.

It creates a Blueprint named 'api' and attaches a RESTful Api instance to it.
It then imports the route modules from this directory (auth_routes, project_routes, task_routes)
so that their @api.resource decorators can be registered.
